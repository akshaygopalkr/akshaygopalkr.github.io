I am a 2nd year Computer Science MS Student at UC San Diego graduating this June. For the past 3 years, I have researched at the [Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Autmobiles](https://cvrr.ucsd.edu/) advised by Dr. Mohan Trivedi where I have studied applications of deep learning and AI for safe autonomous driving. Starting in June 2024, I started research at [SU Lab](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/lab/group.html) and am studying ways to enhance pretraining strategies to improve generalization capabilities of robotic vision-language action models. My primary research interests lie in **large language models**, **object detection and tracking**, and **multi-modal foundation models**, primarily applied for real-time systems such as autonomous driving & robotics. 
 

In my free time, I am an assistant coach for the UC San Diego Men's Club Basketball Team, collect vinyls, run, and watch football and basketball (Go Lakers and 49ers!). I also have mentored high-school students pursuing AI research projects through [Polygence](https://www.polygence.org/).

Update: Starting in May, I'll be joining [NomadicML](https://www.nomadicml.com/) in San Francisco to work as a Founding Machine Learning Engineer. I'm excited to work on developing AI-agents for ultra-specific video analysis :)
