I am a second year Computer Science MS Student at UC San Diego. For the past 3 years, I have researched at the [Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Autmobiles](https://cvrr.ucsd.edu/) advised by Dr. Mohan Trivedi where I have studied applications of deep learning and AI for safe autonomous driving. Starting in June, I started research at [SU Lab](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/lab/group.html) and am studying ways to enhance pretraining strategies for visual grounding of robotic vision-language models. My primary research interests lie in **large language models**, **object detection and tracking**, and **multi-modal foundation models**, primarily applied for real-time systems such as autonomous driving & robotics. 

Besides research, I am also a part time ML Research Intern at [CIPRA.ai](https://cipra.ai/). Here, I am developing seqeuntial, deep-learning based time-series models to help monitor patient blood pressure and glucose levels. 

In my free time, I am an assistant coach for the UC San Diego Men's Club Basketball Team, collect vinyls, run, and watch football and basketball (Go Lakers and 49ers!). I also mentor high-school students pursuing AI research projects through [Polygence](https://www.polygence.org/).



I am actively looking for ML/AI full-time opportunities starting in Summer 2025! You can find my CV [here](https://akshaygopalkr.github.io/files/Akshay_Gopalkrishnan_CV_Public.pdf)
