I am an incoming second year Computer Science MS Student at UC San Diego. For the past 3 years, I have researched at the [Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Autmobiles](https://cvrr.ucsd.edu/) advised by Dr. Mohan Trivedi where I have studied applications of deep learning and AI for safe autonomous driving. My primary research interests lie in **large language models**, **computer vision**, and **multi-modal foundation models**, primarily applied for real-time systems such as autonomous driving & robotics. In my free time, I am an assistant coach for the UC San Diego Men's Club Basketball Team, collect vinyls, run, and watch football and basketball (Go Lakers and 49ers!). I also mentor high-school students pursuing AI research projects through [Polygence](https://www.polygence.org/).

This summer, I am starting research at [SU Lab](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/lab/group.html), where I will be studying how to further improve robotic vision-language models. I am also a ML Research Intern at [CIPRA.ai](https://cipra.ai/) where I will be developing time-series models to predict the blood pressure of patients for monotoring chronic diseases. 


I am actively looking for ML/AI research internships during the fall as well as full-time opportunities in 2025! You can find my CV [here](https://akshaygopalkr.github.io/files/Akshay_Gopalkrishnan_CV_Public.pdf)
