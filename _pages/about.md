I am a first year Computer Science MS Student at UC San Diego. For the past 3 years, I have researched at the [Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Autmobiles](https://cvrr.ucsd.edu/) advised by Dr. Mohan Trivedi where I have studied applications of deep learning and AI for safe autonomous driving. My primary research interests lie in the **language models**, **computer vision**, and **vision-language-intersections**, primarily applied for autonomous driving. Currently, I am working on a thesis project to develop lightweight & efficient vision-language models to perform Visual Question Answering for autonomous driving. In my free time, I am an assistant coach for the UC San Diego Men's Club Basketball Team, collect vinyls, run, and watch football and basketball (Go Lakers and 49ers :))!
